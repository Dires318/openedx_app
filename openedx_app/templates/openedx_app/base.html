Example: Developer melding the 2SoD pattern to fit inside with another pattern::

    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% load static %}

    <!-- Their site uses old school block layout -->
    {% block extra_js %}

        <!-- Your package using 2SoD block layout -->
        {% block javascript %}
            <script src="{% static 'js/ninja.js' %}" type="text/javascript"></script>
        {% endblock javascript %}
